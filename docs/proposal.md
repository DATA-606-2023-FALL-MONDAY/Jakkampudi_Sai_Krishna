## 2. Background

Q1. **What is the Project about?**

It is a critical analysis for us and companies because they directly impact revenue and profitability.By understanding and anticipating customer churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies, reduce customer acquisition costs, make data-driven decisions, maintain a competitive edge, and ultimately maximize profitability.


Q2. **What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?**

a. Identifying specific customer segments or individuals who are likely to churn is crucial for targeted retention efforts.

b. Understanding the behaviors, patterns, or triggers that precede customer churn can help in proactive intervention.

c. Analyzing past efforts and their impact can guide the selection of retention tactics that yield the best results.

d. Assessing the financial impact of retaining customers versus losing them provides insight into the value of churn reduction efforts.

**Which variable/column will be your taget/label in your ML model?**

 - Customer Churn is the most effective target variable for creating machine-learningÂ models from the dataset.
 - It is a binary variable that machine learning systems can classify with ease. 
 - Additionally, there is plenty of information and study on the subject because customer turnover is a regular and significant issue for organizations to address.


**Which variables may be selected as predictors for your ML models?**

 - Tenure
 - WarehouseToHome
 - OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear
 - CashbackAmount
 - avg_cashbk_per_order
